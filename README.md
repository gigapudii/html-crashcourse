# HTML5 cheat sheet and blog page
A basic cheat sheet and a blog page made in HTML5.

## WHY
Let's get a little nostalgic. Between about 1998-'09 I was roaming the Internet's main social media pages such as Skunk.nu, Lunarstorm.se, and Myspace.com. Designing the personal page was a fun way to give a first-impression and attract new friends, and a highly popular one. Hiding meaningful quotes by using the same color as the background, filling the page with advanced ASCII-art, or flashing and moving a welcome text were all possible due to hex-colors, tags, and photos. Ultimately, it wasn't a matter of who made the nicest looking page, but rather, who was able to use the most functions. Without knowing it, I was introduced to web design. And I got quote good at it. But as soon as the trends changed, I no longer spent time improving the skills I already had.

To this day, I have been missing web design. Therefore, I saw this as a chance to refresh my bachelor's degree in media and communications by complementing it with HTML5. It helps me understand today's webpages and allows me to easily learn and apply search engine optimization for a greater marketing impact.

## HOW
To my help, I have been following the tutorial made by Traversy Media: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE" target="_blank">Link to tutorial</a>. The code itself was written in Visual Studio Code.
