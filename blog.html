    <h3>Unlike what is commonly mistaken, HTML is not a programming language but a markup language used to instruct browers on how to display specific content by giving it structure and meaning. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is one of the most common languages for the WWW.</h3>

            <h3>Result 1</h3>
            <small>Posted by Patricia on September 16</small>
            <p>Firstly, it has been interesting to see how much the new version still resembles the old in regards to structure and tags. So, what did I finally learn? I began by writing the cheat sheet to get comfortable with HTML5. This included understanding how to save folders on the computer, and create and name the HTML files, i.e. simple and sweet. This gave me an overview of the needed parts of an HTML page (in very general terms: html tag, head, body, footer). A-tags, headings, paragraphs along with some basic decoration such as making a text bold or highlighted was a nice refresh from the old days. It was also beneficial to learn that HTML code also requires indentation, just as any programming language, for the sake of readability.</p>

            <h3>Result 2</h3>
            <small>Posted by Patricia on September 17</small>
            <p>The cheat sheet lesson continued to teach me the difference between ordered and unordered lists, how to make tables and forms, add placeholder text, and create comments - all very valuable lessons. Further, I got introduced to the difference between <i>input</i> and <i>textarea</i>, and went on learning about how to add simple buttons, images, and various types of quotations.</p>

            <h3>Result 3</h3>
            <small>Posted by Patricia on September 18</small>
            <p>In creating the blog page I finally understood how <i>class</i> is different from <i>id</i>. Creating a header (the black bar above on this page) gave me a visual of how important it is to structure and present the page in sections. Ultimately, I was also introduced to meta tags and understood how they can be used to improve search engine results - the clearer, simple, and repetitive, the better.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <small>Posted by Patricia on September 19</small>
            <p>It has been a very long-awaited and fun experience to finally play around with HTML. I find it much easier to read HTML tags now and write them myself. As more and more jobs require the understanding of web design I believe I now have valuable skills to continue working with this and setting it into practice to help impact how an audience perceives the company brand.</p>
